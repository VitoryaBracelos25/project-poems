                I love you,<br>
                Not only for what you are,<br>
                But for what I am<br>
                When I am with you.<br><br>

                I love you,<br>
                Not only for what<br>
                You have made of yourself,<br>
                But for what<br>
                You are making of me.<br>
                I love you<br>
                For the part of me<br>
                That you bring out;<br>
                I love you<br>
                For putting your hand<br>
                Into my heaped-up heart<br>
                And passing over<br>
                All the foolish, weak things<br>
                That you can’t help<br>
                Dimly seeing there,<br>
                And for drawing out<br>
                Into the light<br>
                All the beautiful belongings<br>
                That no one else had looked<br>
                Quite far enough to find.<br><br>

                IF love were what the rose is,<br>
                And I were like the leaf,<br>
                Our lives would grow together<br>
                In sad or singing weather,<br>
                Blown fields or flowerful closes<br>
                Green pleasure or grey grief ;<br>
                If love were what the rose is,<br>
                And I were like the leaf.<br><br>
                
                If I were what the words are,<br>
                And love were like the tune,<br>
                With double sound and single<br>
                Delight our lips would mingle,<br>
                With kisses glad as birds are<br>
                That get sweet rain at noon ;<br>
                If I were what the words are,<br>
                And love were like the tune.<br><br>
                
                If you were life, my darling,<br>
                And I your love were death,<br>
                We 'd shine and snow together<br>
                Ere March made sweet the weather<br>
                With daffodil and starling<br>
                And hours of fruitful breath ;<br>
                If you were life, my darling,<br>
                And I your love were death.<br><br>
